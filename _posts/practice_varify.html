		<p><b style="color:#7a2359;">INBORN ERRORS OF METABOLISM COLLABORATIVE: DEFINING THE NATURAL HISTORY OF INBORN ERRORS OF METABOLISM</b></p>
		<p>Newborn blood spot screening is undertaken with the primary assumption that early 
		diagnosis and treatment is a good investment of public resources, both for the individuals 
		tested and for society. Although some effects of improved outcomes seem self-evident, for 
		most newborn-screened disorders there is no comprehensive, long-term assessment of outcomes 
		for children identified by screening. To verify the effectiveness of early identification, 
		intervention, and treatment, longitudinal assessment of outcomes is essential. A better 
		understanding of the natural histories of rare metabolic disorders and the effectiveness of 
		current treatments is necessary to provide optimum care and promote the best possible 
		outcomes for children with these conditions. The Inborn Errors of Metabolism Collaborative 
		(IBEMC), consisting of 13 clinics from 10 states, will collect longitudinal data that capture 
		the clinical progress of persons affected with conditions identified by newborn screening, 
		focusing on inborn errors of metabolism. Data will be used to better define the natural 
		histories and understand the effect of treatment interventions. The database will allow for:
		<br><br>
		1. Investigation of the relationship among NBS values, genotype, and early manifestations 
		as well as complications of inborn errors of metabolism; <br><br>2. Evaluation of the impact of early 
		identification and intervention on metabolic conditions; <br><br>3. Informed decision making about 
		optimal public health investment in NBS; <br><br>4. Clarification of the previously undefined natural 
		history of very rare metabolic conditions; and <br><br>5. Identification of current nutritional and 
		therapeutic interventions for children with metabolic conditions and evaluation of their 
		effectiveness. <br><br>The IBEMC will build on the work of the HRSA-funded Region 4 Genetics 
		Collaborative and be developed in collaboration with other national efforts, including the 
		Newborn Screening Translational Research Network. The project will establish innovative 
		practices to engage clinicians in a culture of collaboration, provide incentives to ensure 
		collection of both intake and interval data, as well as offer supports that encourage data 
		analysis. These efforts will result in investigations that provide a foundation for clinical 
		trial design and improved treatment for children with inborn errors of metabolism.  
		As a sufficient number of cases are entered for the rarer disorders, research will provide 
		evidence as to the efficacy of early diagnosis and treatment. If research does not support 
		the assumption on which NBS is based, i.e., early diagnosis and treatment are good 
		investments of public resources, both for the individuals tested and for society, the NBS 
		public health paradigm may change. It is possible that the increase in knowledge about the 
		natural history of IBEM will lead to a change in how conditions are added to the NBS panel 
		and that the conditions currently in the panel may be reviewed and revised.

		<p><b style="color:#7a2359;">PILOT NEWBORN SCREENING PROJECT FOR IDENTIFICATION AND PROSPECTIVE FOLLOWUP OF INBORN ERRORS OF METABOLISM</b></p>
		<p>With an incidence of 1 in 10,000 births, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is one of the most 
		common lethal genetic diseases. In the past decade, the development and increasingly 
		widespread implementation of standard of care protocols and proactive nutritional as well as 
		respiratory support has dramatically improved survival in babies with the severe infantile 
		variant, SMA type I, which accounts for more than 50% of affected children. However, improved 
		survival has not resulted in improved motor outcomes in those identified following the onset 
		of symptoms, largely due to rapid progression during the acute phase, followed by a plateau 
		phase characterized by up to several years of functional stability. Preliminary observations 
		from the STOP SMA study, in which younger siblings were identified early in infancy and 
		enrolled in a subspecialty-based medical home with access to proactive care protocols, have 
		demonstrated improved motor outcomes and survival as compared to their older siblings as well 
		as to a cohort of natural history subjects. This suggests that early intervention may play a 
		significant role in limiting motor neuron loss in the most acute phase of disease 
		progression, resulting in a significant improvement in morbidity, mortality, and motor 
		function. <br><br>The investigators propose to implement a multi-state, multi-region newborn 
		screening (NBS) pilot study to assess the feasibility of a DNA-based assay for homozygous 
		SMN1 deletion to detect infants at risk for the development of SMA, in the NBS laboratory 
		setting. In doing so, they hypothesize:1) that the incidence of affected newborns will 
		parallel predictions from early pilot data, and 2) that identification of infants at risk for 
		SMA via NBS will improve outcomes, including morbidity, mortality, and motor function, as 
		compared to a natural history cohort provided the same proactive nutritional, respiratory, 
		and clinical care protocols via a subspecialty-based medical home. <br><br>In the current 
		application, the investigators will also explore ethical, regulatory, and policy issues 
		regarding the use of NBS to pilot screen for SMA to identify the most optimal consent model. 
		To attempt to improve outcomes in the pre-symptomatic population identified with NBS, they 
		will implement and assess the impact of a multidisciplinary approach to management on health 
		outcomes of SMA infants identified via the proposed pilot. screening 400,000 newborns, the 
		investigators expect to identify at least 40 infants at risk for SMA. Specifically, these 
		infants will be enrolled in a subspecialty-based medical home to coordinate and provide 
		access to proactive care interventions and protocols. <br><br>Finally, the investigators will 
		evaluate the psychosocial impact of early diagnosis on SMA infants and their families. 
		Successful completion of this project will be of value on many fronts, providing the NBS 
		community with an assessment of the accuracy with which the proposed assay identifies those 
		at risk for symptom development, determining the current feasibility and acceptance for a 
		primary DNA-based screening platform, providing the opportunity to prospectively assess 
		outcomes in a group of pre-symptomatically diagnosed infants with early access to coordinated 
		proactive care, and an improved understanding of the impact of early diagnosis for SMA 
		infants and their families. <br><br>It is imperative to provide information on the impact 
		of screening and treatment of conditions, such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), prior to 
		recommendations that such conditions be included in newborn screening (NBS) panels. This 
		project will evaluate NBS for SMA. The study has four aims; 1) explore the ethical, 
		regulatory, and policy issues; 2) implement evaluate NBS to detect infants at risk for 
		development of SMA; 3) implement and assess a medical home model to provide early diagnosis 
		and management of care; and 4) evaluate psychosocial impact of early diagnosis. This project 
		is directly relevant to improving the public's health with evidence-based recommendations for 
		public health programs that affect virtually every newborn in the country.

		<p><b style="color:#7a2359;">LSDS:A PILOT NBS AND EXAMINATION OF THE ASSOCIATED ETHICAL LEGAL & SOCIAL ISSUES</b></p>
		<p>Newborn screening for Fabry, Gaucher, Niemann Pick Types A and B, and Pompe diseases has 
		been proposed in several states, including New York. Each of these lysosomal storage 
		diseases (LSD) has a broad phenotypic spectrum ranging from severe infantile-onset disease to 
		adult-onset, milder phenotypes. Thus, newborn screening for these disorders presents a unique 
		set of complex issues that require investigation prior to the initiatio of mass newborn 
		screening. These issues include determining the clinical and diagnostic accuracy of the 
		screening assay, investigating how to correctly predict phenotype in asymptomatic newborns, 
		and developing algorithms to assist with clinical decision-making about if and when to 
		initiate therapy. In addition, there are novel ethical, legal, and social issus associated 
		with testing infants for potentially later-onset disorders. <br><br>This proposal will explore these 
		issues by implementing a pilot newborn screen in conjunction with the New York State Newborn 
		Screening Program to evaluate the analytic and clinical validity of the screening test and to 
		determine disease incidence in an ethnically diverse population. Screening data will be shared 
		with the Newborn Screening Translational Research Network (NBSTRN). All identified infants 
		will be followed by LSD experts at The Mount Sinai Medical Center for diagnostic evaluation, 
		monitoring, and treatment. Natural history data generated from this research and from 
		existing disease-specific clinical databases will also be shared with the NBSTRN, with the 
		goal of developing models to predict age of onset of disease over the lifespan in order to 
		optimize treatment and avoid premature use of costly therapies. <br><br>The psychological aspects of 
		screening for the LSDs will also be explored, focusing on whether screening for later-onset 
		disorders has harmful short or longer term effects. The psychological impact will be assessed 
		using questionnaires and interviews to evaluate the reactions of parents whose infants are at 
		risk to develop infantile versus later-onset disease. We will also initiate an analysis of 
		the economic impact of a positive diagnosis on families by analyzing monitoring and treatment 
		costs as well as potential difficulties with insurability. Based on these results, an ethics 
		panel will b convened to discuss the particular concerns, including potential harms, that are 
		associated with testing for these disorders, and we will then use this information as the 
		basis for formulating policy recommendations on newborn screening for LSDs in general, and 
		later onset diseases in particular. <br><br>In addition, a symposium will be held to discuss the 
		extent and length of medicolegal responsibility of the medical team involved in the newborn 
		screening of a patient with adult onset disease. In sum, these studies should result in the 
		development of evidence-based, ethically-sensitive, newborn screening and long-term follow up 
		policies that will have considerable influence as newborn screening for the LSDs becomes 
		widely adopted. We will conduct a pilot newborn 
		screening for Fabry, Gaucher, Niemann-Pick Types A and B, and Pompe diseases in approximately 
		80,000 infants born in high birth rate, ethnically diverse New York City hospitals in order 
		to validate the screening assay and to define the natural history of these disorders. 
		Prospective clinical, laboratory, and radiographic data will be collected and analyzed in 
		order to develop evidence-based algorithms for the diagnosis and treatment of these rare 
		disorders. In addition, the unique ethical, legal, an psychosocial issues that are associated 
		with screening for these disorders will be explored.
